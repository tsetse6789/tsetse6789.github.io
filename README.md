## Update Notes:
* #### YouTube Player:
  âœ… UI Improvements Made:
  * Before (Cluttered):
    * 5 buttons per playlist: Rename, Copy, Merge, Info, Export
    * Too many buttons creating visual clutter
    * Harder to scan and use on smaller screens
  * After (Cleaner):
    * 4 buttons per playlist: Rename, Copy, Merge, Other
    * Much cleaner and more organized layout
    * Better usability on mobile devices  


  ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes:
  * Combined Buttons:
    * Removed: Individual "ðŸ“Š Info" and "ðŸ“¤ Export" buttons
    * Added: Single "â‹¯ Other" button with dropdown menu
  * New "Other" Dropdown Menu:
    ```JavaScript
    // JavaScript
    showOtherMenu(playlistName, buttonElement)
    ```
    * Clean dropdown design with header "More Options"
    * Two menu items:
      * ðŸ“Š Playlist Info
      * ðŸ“¤ Export Playlist
    * Smart positioning - adjusts if dropdown goes off-screen
    * Consistent styling with existing UI patterns
  * Enhanced UX Features:
    * Smooth animations - hover effects and transitions
    * Auto-close behavior - clicks outside close the dropdown
    * Proper z-index layering - dropdown appears above other content
    * Dark mode support - matches the app's theme
    * Touch-friendly - works well on mobile devices
  * Visual Benefits:
    * 25% fewer buttons - reduced from 5 to 4 buttons per playlist
    * Cleaner rows - less horizontal scrolling needed
    * Better alignment - more consistent button spacing
    * Professional appearance - follows modern UI patterns  

  ðŸš€ Result:
The playlist management section now looks much cleaner and more professional, while maintaining all the same functionality. Users can still access Info and Export features easily through the "Other" dropdown, but the interface is no longer cluttered with too many buttons! ðŸŽ‰
